#Space Invaders

This is an implementation of the classic game of Space Invaders, written in Java. I tried to make it as true to the original as possible. Original sounds, original graphical style (the window is a grid of pixels that gets updated), and original gameplay. This was my first experience dealing with threads and concurrency in Java (a nightmare) as well using Swing in a non trivial project. Parts of this code could be refactored, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out overall.
