#Space Invaders

This is an implementation of the classic game of Space Invaders, written in Java. I tried to make it as true to the original as possible. This was my first experience dealing with threads and concurrency in Java (a nightmare) as well using Swing in a non trivial fashion. Parts of this code could be refactored, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out overall. 

All of this code was authored by me, with the exception of Location.java, BoundedGrid.java and AbstractGrid.java, which were taken from AP CS case study GridWorld. These are data structures and could be replaced by my own code but they do the job for the time being.
